# Description

> **Note**: This project was created to allow me to learn/discover the [Go](https://golang.org) technology.

This project provides a program that I used to know the number of working days and hours according to Luxembourg public holidays to fill my professional timesheet.

# Usage

```bash
$ timesheet-utils
ðŸ“… 18 working days so 144 working hours until 27/01/2025.
ðŸ“Š 22 working days so 176 working hours in total.
```

# Requirements
